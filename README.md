# Direct MEGA
MEGA downloads working like normal downloads!

## How to use:

When downloading a file replace `https://mega.nz` with `https://directme.ga`. For
improved usability you can also replace the `#` with an `?`.

Everything works in your computer and you can download anything directy from MEGA
without your precious data touching any server (beside MEGA ones, of course).

If you don't want to download add `!view` to the URL and, if the browser can handle the
file, it will be shown instead of downloaded.

Note: it don't work for folders because is quite hard to download folders.

Depends on Service Workers and Streams API ([Chrome Status](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4531143755956224)).
