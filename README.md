## How to use:

When downloading a file replace `https://mega.nz` with `https://directme.ga`. For
improved usability (or in case you're being redirected to this file) you can
replace the `#` with an `?`. If you don't want to download add `!view` to the URL
and, if the browser can handle the file, it will be shown instead of downloaded.

Everything works in your computer and you can download anything directy from MEGA
without your precious data touching any server (beside MEGA ones, of course).

Note: it don't work for folders because is quite hard to download folders.

Depends on Service Workers and Streams API ([Chrome Status](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/4531143755956224)).
